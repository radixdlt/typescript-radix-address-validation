# TypeScript Radix Address Validation

This repository contains a reference implementation of a function that validates Radix account and resource addresses from any network. This is the `validateAddress` function found in the [`./src/main.ts`](./src/main.ts) file and tested in the [`./tests/validation.test.ts`](./tests/validation.test.ts) file.
